All HTML 4.0 entities and character codes are allowed in EZML documents, except
&amp;, &lt;, and &gt;. For these three, the characters &, <, and > should be
used and EZML will automatically convert them to the given entities.

For example, the entities in the list below should not be converted:
 * &eacute;
 * &euro;
 * &#960;
But these should be converted to their entity equivalents:
 * &
 * <
 * >
