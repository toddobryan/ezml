[! Syntax !]

EZML is designed to be easy to remember and use. Every formatting command
consists of a bracket followed by a character designed to remind you of what
it means. For example, headers are important! So the header above is written
by enclosing the title in exclamation points with brackets--[=[[! Syntax !]]=].
The bracket lets you know that the next character is a formatting character and
the exclamation point should remind you of a header, because headers are
important! After you've typed the header, you use the same formatting character
and a close bracket to let EZML know you're done.

All the other formatting characters are similar. If you're formatting text, you
use an open-bracket, a formatting character, type the text, same formatting
character, and a close bracket. Since the formatting characters have been
chosen to be easy to remember, you should be able to figure them out without a
lot of trouble.

[!![@chars@] Special Characters !!]

One of the strengths of HTML is that it's designed to be used by people all
over the world and it has been able to handle international character sets from
its beginning. Unfortunately, it has sometimes been difficult to type those
characters, but with EZML it's--you guessed it--easy.

To type an accented character, you use brackets followed by a character that
should remind you of the accent. For an acute accent, we use the apostrophe: '.
For a grave accent, we use the grave accent at the top left of the keyboard: `.
A [,c] is created by typing [=[[,c]]=]. It's that simple. There are a few characters
that aren't really accented, but are a combination of two or more characters. Examples
include the [sz] from German, the [ae] and [oe] ligatures, or the ellipsis [...]
character. As you might expect, there are codes to handle these cases, too.
Here's a collection of some of the characters you might need to type:

[!![@p@] Paragraphs !!]

To create a paragraph in EZML, simply leave a blank line after a series of
lines. These lines may be hard- or soft-wrapped. In other words, you may or may
not press the return key at the end of each line. If your editor wraps text
automatically, you don't need to bother. If it doesn't, hit return when you feel
like it, and EZML will create a paragraph that grows or shrinks with the size
of the web browser's window.
	This is a bunch of lines
	of text that will become
	a single paragraph of HTML.
will become
	<p>This is a bunch of lines of text that will become a single paragraph of HTML.</p>
and it will be up to the web browser to format it correctly.

[!![@br@] Linebreaks !!]

In standard paragraphs, it's sometimes the case that you want to force
linebreaks to happen at certain points, for example, if you're typing a poem.
Stealing an idea from what you do if you want to indicate linebreaks in a poem,
the formatting character / means to go to the next line. Like all formatting
characters, it's enclosed in brackets: [=[[/]]=]. Here's a little excerpt from
an A.E. Housman poem:
	When I was one-and-twenty[[/]]I heard a wise man say,[[/]]'Give crowns and
	pounds and guineas[[/]]But not your heart away;
which gets rendered as:
	When I was one-and-twenty[/]I heard a wise man say,[/]'Give crowns and
	pounds and guineas[/]But not your heart away;
just the way a poem should be.

Remember that linebreaks should mostly take care of themselves. Only insert them
if you have a very good reason. Since EZML has ways to handle lists, block
quotations, and other situations where you might be tempted to use your own
linebreaks, make sure there's not a better way to handle what you're trying to
do.

[!![@styles@] Text Styles !!]

One of the major advantages of HTML over standard plain text documents is that
it can typeset text in different styles. Some examples:
 * [*bold*] text, when you want to make a point
 * [/italic/] text, when you want to put your own slant on things
 * [=typewriter=] or [=monospace=] font is good for text that a user might have
   to enter into a computer
 * E=mc[^2^] is perhaps the most famous example of an equation with a [^super^]script
 * H[_2_]O shows an example of [_sub_]scripted text
Each of these examples is very easy to create in EZML.

[!!! Bold !!!]

To create bold text, surround it with [=[[*=] and [=*]]=]. You've probably used
the asterisk character to emphasize words in email messages, because it's *so*
common to do that. If you can remember that *[...]* is emphasis, you just have
to add the brackets and you can [*bold whatever you'd like*].

[!!! Italics !!!]

Because italics lean to the right, the forward slash character, [=/=] should
scream [/italics/] to you. To put [/anything/] in italics simply wrap it in
[=[[/=] and [=/]]=].

[!!! Typewriter/Monospace Font !!!]

The unique characteristic of a typewriter font is that every character, from a
wide character like [/m/] to a narrow character like [/i/], takes an equal
amount of horizontal space. Because of that fact, [=[[==] and [==]]=] serve to wrap
anything you'd like to appear in a typewriter font. 

[!!! Superscript and Subscript !!!]

Superscripted text has been raised up. Because the caret symbol, [=^=] (shift-6
on U.S. keyboards) looks like a little up-arrow, you wrap superscripted text
between [=[[^=] and [=^]]=]. For example, if a chemist wanted to write O[^2-^],
it's as simple as [=O[[^2-^]]=].

In contrast, subscripts are low. Since the underscore character, [=_=]
(shift-hyphen), is as low as you can get, wrap subscripted text in [=[[_=] and
[=_]]=]. For example, a mathematician might define the Fibonacci numbers in this
way: f[_n_]=f[_n-1_]+f[_n-2_], which would be written
[=f[[_n_]]=f[[_n-1_]]+f[[_n-2_]]=].

[!!! Mix and Match !!!]

You can combine all of these text styles together however you wish. Want
[*[/bold and italic/]*] text? No problem. Just type
[=[[*[[/bold and italic/]]*]]=]. The one thing to be careful of is to [/nest/]
your styles within one another. In other words, [*it's perfectly fine to put
[/some italic text/] inside a run of bold*]. What's not okay is to try this:
	[[* bold stuff [[/now italic*]] uh-oh, we tried to quit bold before the
	italic was over/]] This is very bad.
Nested formatting--formatting which is entirely contained within another style--
is perfectly fine. Overlapping styles [/[*aren't*]/].

Here's an easy way to remember it: You always have to finish the last thing you
started before you can finish anything else. If you're in a bold passage, feel
free to add some superscript. But you have to close the superscript before you
can close the bold. If you don't, you just confuse the EZML system and could
possibly crash the whole internet[(not_really)].

[(not_really)]: Stop worrying! You can't really crash the whole internet just
 by not following my directions. What you can do is cause the EZML processor to
 create XHTML code that is not well-formed and that would make me very sad. 

[!! Headers !!]

One thing that you'll probably want to do is to break your text into smaller
parts. To add a heading to each part, create a line with just [=[[!=] and
[=!]]=] with the title between them and skip a line afterward. Make sure that
the number of exclamation points matches at each end or you won't get a header,
you'll get actual exclamation points. Also, feel free to put spaces around the
title; these will disappear in the final document.

Actually, there are six levels of headings--the more exclamation points, the
[/smaller/] the heading becomes. (This may seem counterintuitive, but it's rare
to use sizes four through six in real documents, so they take more keystrokes
to type. Just remember the aphorism "less is more" and you'll be fine.) Here are
all the header possibilities:

[! Header1 [[! Header1 !]] !]

[!! Header2 [[!! Header2 !!]] !!]

[!!! Header3 [[!!! Header3 !!!]] !!!]

[!!!! Header4 [[!!!! Header4 !!!!]] !!!!]

[!!!!! Header5 [[!!!!! Header5 !!!!!]] !!!!!]

[!!!!!! Header6 [[!!!!!! Header6 !!!!!!]] !!!!!!]

Note that headers above level 3 or so start becoming smaller than standard text,
so you may want to avoid using them unless you have a very good reason.

[!! Tables !!]

Tables are delimited by [=[[#=]] and [=#]]=] characters because the
[=#=] sign looks a bit like a small table (or at least a Tic-Tac-Toe grid).
At the top of the table use [===] characters to delimit all of the columns
below. Within the table you indicate row breaks using lines of [=-=]'s.
Optionally, you may replace one of the lines of [=-=]'s with a line of
[===]'s. All rows above this line will be considered headers and will
usually be rendered in a bold font. The line of symbols indicating the
end of the table is also a line of [===]'s. 

The line of [===]'s or [=-=]'s [/below/] each row indicates how the row should
be broken up. If you leave spaces, the text will be broken into columns. If
you run the signs together, the columns will be combined into a single
cell. The only rule is that you must indicate all possible columns in the
first line of [===]'s, but within the table you can combine cells however
you wish.

You can also combine rows into a larger cell by indicating broken partial
row lines with [=-=]'s. [(The line indicating where the headers end may
[/not/] be a partial line, but must span the whole table. It's not clear
what partial headers would be, anyway.)]

Here's an example:

[!! Lists !!]

You can type two kinds of lists in EZML, bulleted and numbered. 

[!!! Bulleted Lists !!!]

In a bulleted list, each element appears indented, with a bullet to its
left. To create a bulleted list, put one or more spaces (but not enough to
trigger a pre-formatted block), an asterisk, and each item. If you indent
farther in subsequent lines, you'll get sublists. For example
 * This is a list
 * Each element has a bullet
   * but you can also
     * create smaller sublists
     * inside each bullet
   * by lining up the asterisks
 * so the system is pretty flexible
can be created by typing
	 * This is a list
	 * Each element has a bullet
	   * but you can also
	     * create smaller sublists
	     * inside each bullet
	   * by lining up the asterisks
	 * so the system is pretty flexible
which looks an awful lot like a list.

[!!! Numbered Lists !!!]

Numbered lists are created in a similar way. You begin the list by indenting
a space or two, writing a number symbol (#) followed by a period, and then
typing the list item. Here's a list:
 #. This is a numbered list.
 #. Things are numbered in order.
   #. You can also create sublists.
   #. And they're numbered, too.
 #. Which is kind of cool.
and here's how you'd type that:
	 #. This is a numbered list.
	 #. Things are numbered in order.
	   #. You can also create sublists.
	   #. And they're numbered, too.
	 #. Which is kind of cool.
	 
Numbered lists are, however, much more flexible. If you don't want to start the
list at number one, just replace the number sign with the number you want. In
fact, you can override any number in the list, which is useful if you're
listing things that don't come in strict numeric order:
 3. This is #3.
 5. This is #5.
 #. This is automatic numbering.
 #. And this one, too.
 33. Jump ahead to #33.
 #. Continue automatic numbering.
which you'd type as:
	 3. This is #3.
	 5. This is #5.
	 #. This is automatic numbering.
	 #. And this one, too.
	 33. Jump ahead to #33.
	 #. Continue automatic numbering.

[!!! Numbering Without Numbers !!!]

Numbered lists can be numbered in ways other than simple Arabic numbers.
Other styles include alphabetic numbering (A-Z) or numbering with Roman
numerals (I, II, III, IV, etc.). Either of these can be used in upper- or
lower-case. To start something using alphabetic or Roman numbering, put a
letter or Roman number as the first element.
 I. Upper-Case Roman
   A. Upper-Case Alphabetic
   #. This is automatic.
     1. Arabic
     #. also automatic
       a. lower-case alphabetic
         i. lower-case Roman
         #. automatic
         #. automatic
       #. automatic
     #. automatic
 #. Automatic
   C. This starts at C.
   #. And continues automatically.
     iv. I can start at Roman 4.
     #. and continue automatically.
     #. which took a long time to program.
is written as:
	 I. Upper-Case Roman
	   A. Upper-Case Alphabetic
	   #. This is automatic.
	     1. Arabic
	     #. also automatic
	       a. lower-case alphabetic
	         i. lower-case Roman
	         #. automatic
	         #. automatic
	       #. automatic
	     #. automatic
	 #. Automatic
	   C. This starts at C.
	   #. And continues automatically.
	     iv. I can start at Roman 4.
	     #. and continue automatically.
	     #. which took a long time to program.
Note that you can't start lists at [*letters*] I, V, or X because the system
will think you mean the Roman numeral. C, D, L, and M, however, work because
it's less likely that you'd want to start with 100, 500, 50, or 1000 than with
those letters.

[!! Links !!]

Hypertext wouldn't be hypertext without the ability to link to other pages
and sites. In EZML, there are several ways to type links, but all use brackets
with an 8 just inside them: [=[[8 this is a link 8]]=]. The number 8 was
chosen because it resembles two links in a chain.

[!!! Bare Links !!!]

The easiest (and perhaps least useful way) to provide a link is to simply
put the URL in link brackets:
    [[8 http://www.google.com 8]]
which gets rendered as [8 http://www.google.com 8]

[!!! Links with Text (and Tooltip Titles, Too) !!!] 

In addition to simply providing the URL, you can also provide the text that
will appear as the link. For example:
    [[8 http://www.google.com Google's homepage 8]]
is rendered as [8 http://www.google.com Google's homepage 8].

Finally, you can include a third piece of information. If you include a
title for the link, it will be shown as a tooltip if someone hovers over
the link long enough. Simply enclose the title in double quotes after
the link text. (You can't include a title unless you also include link
text, or EZML will think you want the title to be the link text.)
For example:
    [[8 http://www.google.com Google "Google's homepage" 8]]
which gets rendered as [8 http://www.google.com Google "Google's homepage" 8]
(make sure to hover over the link to see the tooltip).

[!!! Named Links !!!]

You may have noticed that links can get a little long if you include all their
information. To prevent your document from being fragmented by links there's a
much prettier way to put them in your document that increases readability and
makes it easier to manage them.

You can create a named link by writing a link, a colon, the URL, and
(optionally) a link title in quotation marks. Here, for example, are a few
named links:
	[[8 Google 8]]: http://www.google.com "Google Homepage"
	[[8 Python 8]]: http://www.python.org
	[[8 Ubuntu 8]]: http://www.ubuntu.com "Ubuntu - Linux for Human Beings"
You can place these anywhere you'd like in a document. Common choices are after
the first paragraph they're used, or in a group at the bottom of your document.
If a named link is listed anywhere in the document, you can use the name
instead of the whole URL. There are a couple of restrictions: link names can't
contain any spaces and they must be unique within a document. To make it easy
to use them anywhere in a sentence, link names are not case sensitive.

[8 Google 8]: http://www.google.com "Google Homepage"

For example, [=[[8 Google 8]]=] would provide a link to the Google homepage
defined in the named link above. If that's all you put, [8 Google 8] will act
as the link text [/and/] the URL and the tooltip will be grabbed from the named
link. If you want different link text or a different tooltip, you can provide
them as shown here:
	[[8 Google the Google homepage 8]]
	Click [[8 Google here "This is the Google homepage link" 8]] to go to Google.
	You should capitalize [[8 google 8]], but you don't have to.
These render as:
[8 Google the Google homepage 8][/]
Click [8 Google here "This is the Google homepage link" 8] to go to Google.[/]
You should capitalize [8 google 8], but you don't have to.[/]

[!!! Links Within a Document !!!]

To mark a part of the document as something you might want to link to, either
from a table of contents or from another section, use the [=[[@=] and [=@]]=]
tags with a unique name inside. For example, inside the [*Special Characters*]
header above, I included [=[[@ chars @]]=] before the text of the header. As a
result, I can now send you back to that point in the document using a link:
	Go back to the [[8 #chars special characters section 8]]
gets rendered as[/]
Go back to the [8 #chars special characters section 8].

Notice that the word [/chars/] doesn't appear in the spot where you place the
[=[[@ chars @]]=] information--it only provides a place for you to link to.
Also note the number sign before the word [/chars/] in the internal link.

[!! Footnotes !!]

If you want to say something[(irrelevant)], you can use a footnote.

[(irrelevant)]: And by something, we mean something that doesn't really fit in
with what you're currently talking about. 

[!! Blockquotes !!]

> This is a blockquote.
> > This is a blockquote in a blockquote.
> Back to the original level
>     Here's some preformatted code
>     inside the blockquote.

[!! Images !!]

Use [{ pic.png alt text }].
