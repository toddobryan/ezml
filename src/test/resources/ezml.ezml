[! EZML - An Easy Markup Language !]

[*EZML*] is designed to be an easy to use markup language. In particular, it
combines ideas from many different sources to create a language that is both
easy to remember and natural to use.

Probably the greatest single influence on EZML is John Gruber's [8 Markdown 8].
I admire Markdown for its simplicity and readability. Markdown documents
look like what they're supposed to represent--they don't have weird tags or
complicated structure that makes it difficult to see what the writer intended.

[!!! Avoiding Ambiguity !!!]

On the other hand, Markdown is flexible in some places where it doesn't need to
be. Because its audience is experienced web writers, this makes sense. My
audience is different--students and teachers who have very little experience
writing for the web. With a neophyte audience, flexibility is more likely to
lead to confusion than to a sense of empowerment. For that reason, I've
attempted to root out all cases of ambiguity. In EZML, there's one way to do
things, and one way only.

[!!! Making It Hard to Mess Up Normal Prose !!!]

One of the other problems with Markdown is that a few of its formatting
characters get substantial use in normal English prose. For example, Markdown
uses brackets for HTML links. That's usually fine, but brackets also appear in
quotes, math, and science quite a bit. What's more, when people are writing
them, they're not likely to think about needing to escape them. Similarly, it's
very natural for someone to begin a line with "#5". (Check this...does it need
a space?)In Markdown, this would create a large header and our newbie writer
would be very confused.
