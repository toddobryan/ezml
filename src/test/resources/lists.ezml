These are some lists:
 * this is an unordered list
 * with a few bullets
 * One thing to check is whether a single bullet can continue onto multiple
   lines without a problem. Ideally, the text should just be run together into
   one big list item.
 * Unfortunately, that raises the question of what to do with multiple
   paragraphs in a list item.
   
   I'd prefer not to add <p> tags inside a list unless it would consist of
   multiple paragraphs.
   
   But if it does consist of multiple paragraphs, that's exactly what you have
   to do.
   
Now, this should no longer be part of the list above, but because there's a
blank line in front of it, it should be a new paragraph.
 * It [*is*] possible, of course, to continue the same paragraph after a list.
Like this one. Which should be all a single paragraph.

Other kinds of lists are reasonable:
 1. numbered lists
 #. where each
 #. element gets larger
  1. this is a list
  #. within another list

It would also be nice if EZML recognized:
 A. Alpha
 #. numbering
 #. style
or
 a. alpha
 #. if we wanted
or
 I. Roman
 #. numerals
 #. uppercase
or
 i. little roman numerals
 #. which are cute
 
It would also be convenient if you could override numbers:
 2. This is #2.
 5. We've skipped ahead to 5.
 7. And this is 7.
or start somewhere other than 1 and number automatically.
 III. this should be Roman 3.
 #. Roman 4
 #. Roman 5
