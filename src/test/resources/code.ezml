There are some code examples here:
	this is code
	  this line should be indented two more spaces
	the next line is blank, but should still be part of the code block

	just as this one is
	[=code=], [*bold*], [/italic/], 
	[^super^]script, and [_sub_]script should be allowed.
This should still be part of the above paragraph, but outside code.

This is a new paragraph:
	with some code
	  in it
	  
And another new paragraph.
