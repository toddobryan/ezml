<p>There are some code examples here:
<pre>this is code
  this line should be indented two more spaces
the next line is blank, but should still be part of the code block

just as this one is
<code>code</code>, <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, 
<sup>super</sup>script, and <sub>sub</sub>script should be allowed.</pre>
This should still be part of the above paragraph, but outside code.</p>

<p>This is a new paragraph:
<pre>with some code
  in it</pre></p>

<p>And another new paragraph.</p>
